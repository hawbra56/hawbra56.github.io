<p>One of my best friends Aaron Buckley started leather working as a hobby not long after a bad motorcycle accident. What started as a hobby turned into a full time business and it only made sense to build an ecommerce solution to sell his leather goods online. Througout the project I collaborated with two other designers who happened to also be good friends Aaron and I, Jessie Jay Mademann and Alex Bloom. Although I was mostly in charge of the wordpress theming, front-end development and woocommerce integration, all off us were in charge of the design in some fashion.</p>
